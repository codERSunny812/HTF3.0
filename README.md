<!-- about app -->

## About the App

After participating in several hackathons, I am attending my first in person  and as part of the process I needed to put the project here, so I hope you enjoy it 😊

The challenge is  to help  doctor to save time and avoid the wastage of the medicine which was due to the over precription which is caused when the patient lost thier  reports and doctor don't know how much medicine is sufficient for the patient  and  the patient can download thier report throught our app just by entering the adhar no.   😰

That's why we created app, a platform on which only doctor can upload the reports of the patient by signing up into  our app . 🤩


Charak app is ready for launch! We are waiting for store review and as soon as we are on we will share the link with you guys.

<!-- We are happy to receive [feedback](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/hackatrack-1) and answer any Qs about the project and its future! 🙂 -->

## Our mission

Our mission is to reduce stress and save the time of the patient  and doctor both and  reduce thier tension of handling their  medical report. Once the 
report is  uploaded  on the  app  and it's always available in our appp. At any time the patient can download thier report. 

## Features

- ✅ **Login into the app**: You can login  into the app easily ! 

- ✅ **Upload your report**: Once you are login you can easily upload your bill  😄


- ✅ **Download your report**: You can download your report anytime anywhere ! 🖥 .
